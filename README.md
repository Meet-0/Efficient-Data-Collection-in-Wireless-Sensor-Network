# Efficient-Data-Collection-in-Wireless-Sensor-Network

The whole project is designed as to Efficiently collect data from sensor networks. The time taken to collect data from all the sensors through mobile sensor and transmit it to the main station should be as minimal as possible. In case of any casuality, the main focus is to inform the main station as soon as possible in order to take actions accordingly. We designed a pattern in a way that the main station gets information efficiently by saving time as well as reduced number of laps for mobile sensor which indirectly saves power.
